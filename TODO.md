# Todo
- Better theme previews
    - Upon editing each property, ensure the preview mode updates to display a UI where the user can clearly see the changes being made to the theme (same as theme studio does it)
- Themes API (for integration with UX Canvas) - just store env var API_KEY_FOR_UXCANVAS
- Better theme customization
    - Font customization
    - Border radius customization
    - Spaciousness customization? (padding, 3 settings maybe tight default loose)
- SEO audit + improvement
