I want to create an AI influencer platform using google's new ai image gen model nano banana and veo 3 for video gen. We will use their APIs. 

It will be a nextjs app with typescript, supabase, tailwind css, drizzle orm for db. The user should be able to create new influencers (give them a name and personality and generate an image of them via nano banana + refine them (keep generating iterations of them with nano banana till satisfied)

Then once they have their AI influencer, they will be able to generate new videos using veo 3 model.

# LOW PRIORITY

- We will use AI sdk too to generate suggestions for influencers, suggestions for tweaks in the iteration UX to get the influencer character design right, and 

- User should also be able to bring their own influencer by uploading an image of the influencer/character.
